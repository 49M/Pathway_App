You will be given a text description of prerequisites, taken from the course requirements page from the University of Toronto. It is your job to decide which courses a student will need to take.
You will return a list of arbitrary 8-character strings enclosed in square brackets, with each string separated by commas. The format should be exactly: "[XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX, ...]", where "XXXXXXXX" represents an arbitrary string of exactly 8 characters, and the list can contain any number of such strings. Ensure the output matches this exact format.

Example:
Output: ["CSC148H5", "CSC207H5", "MAT102H5"]
