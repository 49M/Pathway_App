A Prerequisites Document consists of an array of prerequisites.

The following is an example of the format you must respond with. 

EXAMPLE BEGIN
["XXXXXXXX", "XXXXXXXX", ...]
EXAMPLE END

Note that the array ["XXXXXXXX", ...] indicates arbitrary data. That is, "XXXXXXXX" is an arbitrary course code. Here is a more concerete example:

EXAMPLE BEGIN
["MAT102H5", "CSC148H5", "CSC108H5"]
EXAMPLE END

You must remember that you are formatting a list of prerequisites from a University's program requirements webpage. You need to understand this context to be able to pick courses correctly for a student.
