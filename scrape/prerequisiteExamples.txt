BEGIN EXAMPLE 1
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT132H5 or MAT135H5 or MAT137H5 or MAT157H5 or MAT135H1 or MATA29H3 or MATA30H3 or MATA31H3"
OUTPUT: ["MAT135H5"]
Explanation: All of the prerequisites are separated by the "or" keyword, so you only need to pick one.
END EXAMPLE 1

BEGIN EXAMPLE 2
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT257Y5 or (MAT236H5 and MAT244H5)"
OUTPUT: ["MAT236H5", "MAT244H5"]
Explanation: within the brackets, there is an "and" between the two courses. This means that BOTH courses must be selected.
END EXAMPLE 2

BEGIN EXAMPLE 3
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT257Y5 or (MAT236H5 and MAT244H5)"
OUTPUT: ["MAT257Y5"]
Explanation: Since there is an "or" statement between MAT257Y5 and the brackets containing the two other courses, only one needs to be selected.
In this case, only "MAT257Y5" is selected.
END EXAMPLE 3
