BEGIN EXAMPLE 1
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT132H5 or MAT135H5 or MAT137H5 or MAT157H5 or MAT135H1 or MATA29H3 or MATA30H3 or MATA31H3"
OUTPUT: ["MAT135H5"]
Explanation: All of the prerequisites are separated by the "or" keyword, so you only need to pick one.
END EXAMPLE 1

BEGIN EXAMPLE 2
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT257Y5 or (MAT236H5 and MAT244H5)"
OUTPUT: ["MAT236H5", "MAT244H5"]
Explanation: within the brackets, there is an "and" between the two courses. This means that BOTH courses must be selected.
END EXAMPLE 2

BEGIN EXAMPLE 3
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT257Y5 or (MAT236H5 and MAT244H5)"
OUTPUT: ["MAT257Y5"]
Explanation: Since there is an "or" statement between MAT257Y5 and the brackets containing the two other courses, only one needs to be selected.
In this case, only "MAT257Y5" is selected.
END EXAMPLE 3

BEGIN EXAMPLE 4
INPUT: "Prerequisites: MAT102H5 and (MAT134H5 or MAT136H5 or MAT137Y5 or MAT139H5 or MAT157Y5 or MAT159H5 or MAT233H5)"
OUTPUT: ["MAT102H5", MAT136H5]
Explanation: There is an "and" between MAT102 and the several courses in the brackets, meaning MAT102 MUST BE selected and AT LEAST ONE of the courses in brackets must be selected.
In this case, only "MAT136H5" is selected.
END EXAMPLE 4
